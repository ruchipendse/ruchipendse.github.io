# About
Hey there! I'm Ruchi, a Master's student at Duke, studying Quantum Computing. I'm primarily interested in quantum error correction and quantum computing architecture.
For my Master's thesis, I have been working the circuit-level simulations of double-pass MWPM decoding for correlated errors on an asymmetric surface code under the guidance of Prof. Kenneth R. Brown.


# Research Interests

My (current) research inclination is to develop protocols that bring us closer to fault tolerance.  This may look like tailoring codes to be robust against specific noise or architecting the system in such a way as to use existing qubits or developing techniques to reduce qubit requirements in the system/circuit, or creating a software stack to better use classical processing to aid quantum computation (e.g. such as in error mitigation techniques).

- Quantum Error Mitigation
- Reducing overhead for magic state distillation
