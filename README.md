# About
Hey there! I'm Ruchi. I am currently the engagement lead at IBM Quantum, working closely with the Illinois Quantum and Microelectronics Park, the National Quantum Algorithm Center, and managing IBM Quantum's long-term collaborations with the University of Chicago, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Outside of my day job, my side gig at IBM is to work on updating the BP-OSD decoder for a type of correlated error at very low error rates.
I earned my Master of Science from Duke University in 2023, focusing on quantum computing. For my thesis, I ran code-capacity simulations of double-pass MWPM decodng for correlated errors on an asymmetric surface code under the guidance of Prof. Kenneth R. Brown.
I enjoy running, reading, and writing. 

# Community and Outreach
I'm happily commited to building a deep tech ecosystem in Chicago. As part of that effort, I enjoy participating in community outreach to help bring more people into the fold of STEM, quantum computing, and technology.

- I was happy to be invited to speak at the Polsky Center <a href="https://polsky.uchicago.edu/programs-events/deep-tech-ventures-corporate-collision/speakers/" target="_blank"> about quantum computing, IBM Quantum's commitments in the Illinois quantum ecosystem, the IBM Quantum System Two coming to Chicago, and IBM Quantum's startup network.
<br>
- I will be speaking at SMTA International on what quantum computing can bring to industries in October 2025.


# (Research) Interests

My (current) research inclination is to develop protocols that bring us closer to fault tolerance.  This may look like tailoring codes to be robust against specific noise or architecting the system in such a way as to use existing qubits or developing techniques to reduce qubit requirements in the system/circuit, or creating a software stack to better use classical processing to aid quantum computation (e.g. such as in error mitigation techniques).
